Version: 0.2.4

+ Nicholas' Combat Simulator +

This is little project I worked lately, it is very simple, and is mostly for my own education purposes. 
and I hope it will grow, everyone can make pull requests to improve code, because I am newcomer, I made lots of mistakes, and there been many bugs.

Most likely, all this repo is planning for next game.
